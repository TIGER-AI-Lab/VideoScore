## News
[2024-08-05] We released the Wandb training cruves of [VideoScore](https://api.wandb.ai/links/xuanhe/ptohlfcx) and [VideoScore-anno-only](https://api.wandb.ai/links/xuanhe/4vs5k0cq) to help reproduce the training results.


## Introduction

üöÄThe recent years have witnessed great advances in video generation. However, the development of automatic video metrics is lagging significantly behind. None of the existing metric is able to provide reliable scores over generated videos. 
ü§îThe main barrier is the lack of large-scale human-annotated dataset.

- üõ¢Ô∏è**VideoFeedback Dataset**. In this paper, we release VideoFeedback, the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multiaspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models.

- üèÖ**VideoScore**. We train VideoScore (initialized from Mantis) based on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman correlation between VideoScore and humans can reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that VideoScore has consistently much higher correlation with human judges than other metrics.

- ü´°**Human Feedback for Video generative models**. Due to these results, we believe VideoScore can serve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to track progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.

## Installation

- for inference
```bash
pip install -e . 
```
- for evaluation
```bash
pip install -e .[eval] 
```
- for training
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/Mantis
cd Mantis
pip install -e .[train,eval]
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# then training scripts are in Mantis/train/scripts
```

## Dataset
- [ü§ó VideoFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/VideoFeedback) VideoFeedback contains a total of 37.6K text-to-video pairs from 11 popular video generative models, with some real-world videos as data augmentation. The videos are annotated by raters for five evaluation dimensions: Visual Quality, Temporal Consistency, Dynamic Degree, Text-to-Video Alignment and Factual Consistency, in 1-4 scoring scale. 

- [ü§ó VideoScore-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/VideoScore-Bench) 
We derive four test sets from 
VideoFeedback, 
[EvalCrafter](https://github.com/evalcrafter/EvalCrafter), 
[GenAI-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/GenAI-Bench) and 
[VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench) respectively to curate VideoScore-Bench. 
VideoScore-Bench is composed of about 7,000 videos, covering both Likert-scale annotation and human preference data.  

## Model
- [ü§ó VideoScore](https://huggingface.co/TIGER-Lab/VideoScore) VideoScore is a video quality evaluation model, taking [Mantis-8B-Idefics2](https://huggingface.co/TIGER-Lab/Mantis-8B-Idefics2) as base-model and trained on [VideoFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/VideoFeedback). 

- [ü§ó VideoScore-anno-only](https://huggingface.co/TIGER-Lab/VideoScore-anno-only) VideoScore-anno-only is a variant of VideoScore, trained on VideoFeedback with the real videos excluded.


## Inference examples

cd examples
python run_mantiscore.py
```
